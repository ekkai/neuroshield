# NeuroShield

The NeuroShield is an evaluation board featuring one NM500 chip ready to interface to a FPGA via an 28-pin input/output bus. It has been designed to enable academic and research teams to get a quick perception of the NM500 chipâ€™s simplicity of deployment, speed and low-power consumption.
